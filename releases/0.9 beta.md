### Arches Collector 0.9 beta release notes

The Arches Collector team has been busy improving Arches Collector and fixing several bugs as well.
Below you'll find a listing of all the changes that are included in the latest release.

Some of the highlights:
-


<!-- #### Upgrading Arches

Users are encouraged to update at their earliest convenience.  Completely re-installing Arches is the easiest way to accomplish this.

If you can't completely re-install Arches (because you have data in the system that you want to preserve) then you'll need to upgrade by running the following commands in your activated virtual environment:

```
pip install arches --upgrade --no-binary :all:
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py es delete_indexes
python manage.py es setup_indexes
python manage.py es index_database
```

If you have Arches running on a web server such as Apache, be sure to update your static files directory and restart your web server.

As always the documentation can be found at <http://arches.readthedocs.io> -->

<!-- #### Upgrading an Arches project -->

<!-- #### Changes
-   Upgrade of django from 1.11.14 to 1.11.15 [#4085](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/pull/4085) -->
